              My approach is based in a felt-perception of alignment. I am often
              approached by those seeking a perspective within a body of work
              that tells a story.I enjoy allowing freedom to fall within my
              approach and later structuring the bones of what will come to be.
              But it all begins with a mirror, visualizing myself within the
              space, within the message, within the moment.
